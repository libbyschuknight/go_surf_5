# Go Surf (Rails 5, Ruby 2.3.0)

https://waffle.io/libbyschuknight/go_surf_5

The main purpose of this repo is to create a Rails apps that has lots of iterations.

I wanted to use a topic that I found interesting, so it is based around where I have and where I want to go surfing.

In the long term I am aiming to use this idea to create sites/apps in other languages and/or add other things to this site (e.g. react).

I am also going to endeavour to document what I do and maybe make it into some sort of tutorial or learning resource to help people get started into Rails.

Note: Septmeber 2016 - I started this in Rails 4 but after the August 2016 RailsGirlsWgtn event I decided it might be more useful to do it in Rails 5. This repo is the Rails 5 version. Here is link to the Rails 4 vesrion (it is incomplete) - [Go Surf Project in Rails 4](https://github.com/libbyschuknight/go_surf)
